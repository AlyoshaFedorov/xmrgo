\begin{abstract}
    XMRGO is the combination of Ergo and Monero. A privacy-oriented currency 
    and smart contract platform. Taking the best of both worlds to create a 
    new form of private smart money. The combination comes from the smart 
    contract capabilities of Ergo and the privacy of Monero. Monero is a 
    private and fungible currency. Ergo is the next generation smart 
    contract platform. The goal of XMRGO is to create a completely 
    anonymous, unlinkable, and untraceable smart contract platform.

\section*{Why Ergo and Monero?}

\indent Ergo is the top-of-the-line smart contract platform for PoW. Monero 
is the top-of-the-line privacy coin for PoW. Combing their powers together 
will create the most private and technologically advance smart contract and 
currency blockchain. This is no easy feat but it must be done to ensure that 
the future of blockchain technology will not be ruined.

\subsection*{Privacy-based Finance}

\indent This coin is not meant to be sold on centralized exchanges, CEX, where 
the know-your-customer, KYC, is dominant and well-practiced. The XER coin 
should only be obtainable via decentralized exchanges, peer-to-peer trading, 
and mining rewards. It is a coin for those to have the option out of the 
standard practices of cryptocurrencies, ruining privacy for maximizing 
profits, e.g. informing CEX to require view keys like in Monero. This is a 
coin for true privacy while allowing smart contracts to exist for complex 
financial transactions. The project will always remain open-source. It is built 
by developers working towards the dream of financial freedom and untraceable 
smart money.


\subsection*{XMRGO Protocol}

\indent The Xmrgo protocol is a combination of Ergo and Monero. It blends the 
vision of Ergo and Monero into a single entity for a singular purpose. It is 
designed to be a privacy-based decentralized finance platform.

\subsection*{Key Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Smart Contracts Using $\Sigma$-protocols
    \item Modified Ergo + Monero Emission Rate
    \item RandomX Consensus Protocol
    \item Monero transaction security
\end{itemize}

\section*{The XMRGO Vision}

\indent Xmrgo is very private and can only be changed in the future by the 
community. There exist many principles that should be followed in Xmrgo. 
In case of intentional violation of any of these principles, the resulting protocol should not be called Xmrgo.
